About me
======
Hi! I’m Halima Salah, a Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Wayne State University, where I specialize in atmospheric modeling, air quality, and public health. My research bridges environmental engineering and data science, with a focus on how emissions, climate, and urban systems interact to shape health outcomes—especially in under-resourced communities.

I care deeply about the public health implications of air pollution, the equity dimensions of environmental exposure, and the transparency and accessibility of environmental data. I also lead community-engaged science programs that bring environmental education to youth and underrepresented communities, and I’m committed to interdisciplinary approaches that connect science, storytelling, and social justice.

My Work and Research
======
I study the intersection of air quality, environmental data, and public health, with a focus on how pollution impacts vulnerable communities. My work integrates atmospheric modeling, emissions inventory evaluation, satellite data analysis, and health risk assessment to better understand how pollutants like PM₂.₅, NO₂, and ozone affect human health on both local and global scales.

In my dissertation, I conduct intercomparisons of global emissions inventories and assess the resulting variations in human health impacts due to air pollution. I use tools such as the CESM CAM-chem model and the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to simulate long-term exposure and estimate premature deaths and years of life lost.

I was the 2022–2023 Ralph Cicerone Fellow in Earth System Science Modeling at the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), where I worked in the Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Lab (ACOM). In 2021–2022, I was awarded the NSF-funded T-RUST (Transformative Research in Urban Sustainability Training) fellowship at Wayne State University, where I co-led the graduate seminar “Emerging Hazards Associated with Climate Change.” I was also the inaugural [UN-RCE Detroit-Windsor Fellow] (https://s.wayne.edu/unrce/2023/09/14/introducing-halima-salah-our-inaugural-un-rce-graduate-fellow/) for 2023–2025, where I work at the intersection of environmental sustainability, education, and community engagement.

Across all my work, I am committed to bridging rigorous atmospheric research with community-informed environmental justice and expanding access to environmental data.

Background
------
I am a Somali-Canadian researcher and engineer, raised between North America, Somalia, and the Gulf. My academic and personal journey has been shaped by cross-cultural experiences and a deep awareness of the environmental injustices affecting communities in both the Global South and the industrialized world.

I earned my B.Sc. in Civil Engineering with a minor in Environmental and Water Engineering from the American University of Sharjah (AUS) in the United Arab Emirates in 2017. Before graduate school, I worked in water resources and wastewater treatment industry. I went on to complete my M.S. in Civil Engineering at Wayne State University in 2021 and am currently persueing my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
